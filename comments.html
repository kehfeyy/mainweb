          <h2>Comments Page</h2>
          <div class="columns">
          This page includes my personal reflection on overall design of this website. It contains some comments regarding technical, visual and accessibility aspects of the website. These elements are essential to create a professional website. Overall, my website is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Users can click on top left to go back to homepage anytime they want whenever the users are reviewing my website.<p></p>
          The <span>header</span> of the page is the sticky bar on top with the name of the website, title of webpage and a way to contact me. It is defined as '.sticky' in css file. I used 'h1' tag for the title of the page due to its large size so that it can be noticable by users. There is a navigation link on top right for user to select if they wish to contact me. The link will bring them to Microsoft outlook with my email attached.<p></p>
          <span>Main</span> contains the contents of the page including the headings using 'h2' tag. I use 'h3' and 'h4' tags for sub-headings, 'img' tags for images, 'table' tags for tables, 'ol' or 'ul' tags for ordered and unordered lists and 'p' tag for paragraph text. Besides, I used different types of element in main, such as id and class. I used css class like '.column1', '.column2' to let images or text to float beside each other.<p></p>
          The <span>footer</span> is also the menu for users to change page or return to the top of the page. I used pictures instead of just text for navigation. There are also text on top of each picture so that users can know which one to select to go to desired page. All the images and text are defined as '.home' '.past' '.future' and '.comments' in css file. I used hover over effects to let users interact and engage with the menu.

            <h2>Visual</h2>

            <div class="text1">
            <h3>Text</h3>
            <h4>Font size</h4>
            <p>I have used appropriate font size so that it can be read by viewers easily. No font is smaller than 18px, including the smallest text which is inside the paloroid on my Home page.</p>
            <h4>Font family</h4>
            <p>I select 'Sans-serif' as the font throughout the entire website to achieve optimal readability. This font is easy to read and more appealing to users. Serif is selected for the headings. Two different types of fonts were chosen for user to differentiate between headings and body.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="color1">
                <h3>Picture</h3>
            <h4>Picture at the footer</h4>
            <p>When hover over, it changes color to signify interaction. Color scheme of the pictures used is similar as the background picture and will catch users' attentions.</p>
            <h4>Background Picture</h4>
            <p>Picture chosen is plain, simple with light colors. The reason I use this picture because it contains light colors which tend to give out bright and positive vibes to viewers. It is also simple and plain therefore it does not look messy with the content on the page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"> <br>
            </div>

            <div class="text1">
                 <h3>Color scheme</h3>
            <p>Color is consistent throughout whole website. The colors chosen do not strain the users' eyes. Only light, pastel colors are used (except for the color of text) to give off bright, positive vibes for the viewers.</p>
            <p>Text is contrast well with the background it is placed on.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="color1">
                <h3>Layout</h3>
                <h4>Headings</h4>
            <p>Page title has the largest font size which will draw users attention and viewers will understand what informations they're looking at</p>
            <h4>Padding and Margin</h4>
            <p>Both padding and margin are used between text and images, text in tables to make website looks less cluttered, more presentable and more minimal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <br>


            <div class="accessibility">
                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <h4>1. Structure</h4>
            <ul><li>Standard HTML tags has been used throughout the whole website. Moreover, the headings in table are defined by 'th' tag which allows webpage to remain its structure when stylesheet is switched off.</li></ul>
            <h4>2. Font Size</h4>
            <ul><li>Font size has been kept to appropriate sizes so that viewers have no trouble looking at the text. Font can also be resized freely by users when they zoom in and out on their browser.</li></ul>
            <h4>3. Altribute Tag</h4>
            <ul><li>Altribute or 'alt' tag has been specified on every images. Therefore, if images are switched off or screen reader are used, the alt text will replace the images, giving people a general idea of the image without actually looking at it.</li></ul>
            <h4>4. Headings</h4>
            <ul><li>Font size and font family of the headings is different from the text in paragraph to prevent confusion. It is also big enough to catch people's attention.</li></ul>
            <h4>5. Font Color</h4>
            <ul><li>Dark colors, such as black and dark blue have been used to contrast with the light colored background so that it is easy for users to read.</li></ul>
            <h4>6. Navigation at bottom</h4>
            <ul><li>Users can return to top of the page or go to other pages when they finished reading the page therefore the menu is at the footer instead of the header.</li></ul>
            <h4>7. Font Spacing</h4>
            <ul><li>The letter spacing looks evenly balanced therefore it is easier to read and looks more organised.</li></ul>
