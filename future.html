            <h2>My Future</h2>
            <p>In this page, you will know what I'm planning to do in the future.</p>


            <div class="border1">
                <h2>Academic</h2>
                <div class="under">
                    <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
                    <p>I want to challenge myself to try and get High Distinction for all my subjects in my degree in UTS. It's going to be so difficult but I will try my best to achieve my goals.</p>
            <p>To achieve my goal, I am going to create a timetable to manage my time to balance sports, work, social life and academic.</p>
            <p>I have to be discipline and try to follow the timetable as much as I can so that I can be efficient.</p>
            </div><div class="post">
            <h3>Postgraduate</h3>
            <p>After graduating from UTS in three years time, I might study further and get a Master degree.</p>
            <p>If I get excellent results throughout my whole degree in UTS, hopefully I can get scholarship for my Master degree. My parents will not have to stress about the expensive living cost, tuition fees and rent. Therefore, they will have less burden.</p>
            <p></p>

            <div class="border1">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Internships</h3>
            <p>I want to try to get as many internships as possible during winter and summer break.</p>
            <p>By doing this, not only I can get experience, I can also make lots of good connections.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, I feel like I learn and understand more things through internship compared to study from a book.</p>

            <h2>Dream Job</h2>
            <div class="job1">
            <h3>Data analyst</h3>
            <p>Data analyst collects, cleans and interprets data sets to answer a question or solve a problem. I think it is a fun, interesting and challenging job.</p>

            </div> <div class="job2">
                <h3>Content creator</h3>
            <p>This is a relatively new career. I enjoy taking pictures and videos and upload it onto social media. I will probably consider this as my side job instead of my main job.</p>

                <h3>Data scientist</h3>
            <p>Similar to data analyst, I love solving problems which is what data scientist does. I feel satisfied after solving a problem and I love how challenging it is.</p>
